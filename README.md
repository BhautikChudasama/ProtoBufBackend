# Demo of Google Sheets API and ProtoBuffer

Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.

## How it's work

## ProtoBuf advantages

- Schema with .proto
- Automatic compress
- Tight Security

We must have .proto file to get or set data.

We can access GoogleSheets using ServiceAccount and must add that service account email to Sheet.
